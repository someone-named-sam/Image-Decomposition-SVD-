# Image-Decomposition-SVD-
Simple program for image decomposition using Singular Value Decomposition. It breaks down an image into its singular values and matrices, showing how SVD can be applied for image compression and reconstruction. By retaining only a subset of the singular values which carry the most amount of data, the project showcases efficient image storage and reduced file sizes with minimal quality loss.

Key Features:

Decompose images using SVD
Reconstruct images with reduced singular values
Visualize image compression results
Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn
